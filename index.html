      <div id="tribute-info">
        <p>You find yourself on the edge of some town that's nothing but edges. You're
        lost in some forgotten diner that never got the memo about passage of time.
        On the walls hang advertisements for items that you don't remember but still
        retain some sort of familiarity.</p>

        <p>You don't know why, but the place is packed with circus performers. Fire
        jugglers, sword swallowers, even a bearded lady. Two twins have managed to
        rack up a game of billiards on their table, among their plates of steak and
        eggs. The only reason that you're not sure there is an elephant around is
        because there is just too many people in this place.</p>

        <p>You pull out a half empty pack of Lucky Strikes. The wrapper is all crushed
        from traveling in your jacket, but the cigarettes are fine. You decide you're
        gonna sit here and smoke every last cigarette in this pack, and think about
        June and the wind and if the two will ever come together in your favor.</p>

        <p>Suddenly you hear a strange voice come over on the house PA. What kind of
        diner has a PA? His voice is like a monsoon after the water has receded.
        He welcomes the crowd for coming and gives the normal introduction. Apparently
        there's a special on the Nebraska scallops.</p>

        <p>This man then sits down at a piano a begins to play a few chords. The room then
        fills with a tune so piercing, you had to double check that it was coming
        from the man with the washboard voice. You think of June again. You realize the
        wind will never come.</p>

        <p>He later brings a band on stage. None of them are holding what you would call
        musical instruments. They bang out a song that in another life you might think
        as "danceable." You don't know who this cat is, but at the end of the night,
        you decide he's alright with you.</p>

        <p>A loud honk goes through the crowd. There's that elephant after all.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Welcome to the world of Tom Waits. It's a world filled with the strange
          and the sorrowful, the weird and the wonderful. I hope that this site
          will provide a stepping stone into such a world to enjoy.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Avenue</p>
          <p>Well Eddie Grace's Buick got four bullet holes in the side
          And Charlie DeLisle is sittin at the top of an avocado tree
          Mrs. Storm will stab you with a steak knife if you step on her lawn
          I got a half a pack of Lucky Strikes man so come along with me
          And let's fill our pockets with macadamia nuts
          And go over to Bobby Goodmanson's and jump off the roof</p>

          <p>Well Hilda plays strip poker with the Mummers 'cross the street
          Joey Navinski says she put her tongue in his mouth
          And Dicky Faulkner's got a switchblade and some gooseneck risers
          That eucalyptus is a hunchback there's a wind down from the south</p>

          <p>So let me tie you up with kite string and I'll show you the scabs on my knee
          Watch out for the broken glass put your shoes and socks on
          And come along with me</p>

          <p>Let's follow that fire truck I think your house is burnin down
          And go down to the hobo jungle and kill some rattlesnakes with a trowel</p>

          <p>And we'll break all the windows in the old Anderson place
          And we'll steal a bunch of boysenberries and I'll smear em on your face</p>

          <p>I'll get a dollar from my mama's purse and buy that skull and crossbones ring</p>

          <p>And you can wear it round your neck on an old piece of string</p>

          <p>Then we'll spit on Ronnie Arnold and flip him the bird
          And slash the tires on the school bus now don't say a word
          I'll take a rusty nail and scratch your initials in my arm
          And I'll show you how to sneak up on the roof of the drugstore
          I'll take the spokes from your wheelchair and a magpie's wings
          And I'll tie 'em to your shoulders and your feet
          I'll steal a hacksaw from my dad and cut the braces off your legs
          And we'll bury them tonight out in the cornfield
          Just put a church key in your pocket we'll hop that freight train in the hall</p>

          <p>We'll slide all the way down the drain to New Orleans in the fall</p>
