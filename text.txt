You find yourself on the edge of some town that's nothing but edges. You're
lost in some forgotten diner that never got the memo about passage of time.
On the walls hang advertisements for items that you don't remember but still
retain some sort of familiarity.

You don't know why, but the place is packed with circus performers. Fire
jugglers, sword swallowers, even a bearded lady. Two twins have managed to
rack up a game of billiards on their table, among their plates of steak and
eggs. The only reason that you're not sure there is an elephant around is
because there is just too many people in this place.

You pull out a half empty pack of Lucky Strikes. The wrapper is all crushed
from traveling in your jacket, but the cigarettes are fine. You decide you're
gonna sit here and smoke every last cigarette in this pack, and think about
June and the wind and if the two will ever come together in your favor.

Suddenly you hear a strange voice come over on the house PA. What kind of
diner has a PA? His voice is like a monsoon after the water has receded.
He welcomes the crowd for coming and gives the normal introduction. Apparently
there's a special on the Nebraska scallops.

This man then sits down at a piano a begins to play a few chords. The room then
fills with a tune so piercing, you had to double check that it was coming
from the man with the washboard voice. You think of June again. You realize the
wind will never come.

He later brings a band on stage. None of them are holding what you would call
musical instruments. They bang out a song that in another life you might think
as "danceable." You don't know who this cat is, but at the end of the night,
you decide he's alright with you.

A loud honk goes through the crowd. There's that elephant after all.
